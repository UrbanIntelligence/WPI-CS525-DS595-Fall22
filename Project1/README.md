#### Total Points
* 100 (One Hundred)

## Goal

In this assignment, you will be asked to implement policy iteration and value iteration for the Frozen Lake environment from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#toy_text) and play the game with the algorithms you implemented. This project will be completed in Python 3.

## Deliverables

Please compress your mdp_dp.py file into a zipped file (firstName_lastName_hw1.zip) and submit it to Canvas.

## Grading
* policy evaluation (20 points)
* policy improvement (20 points)
* policy iteration (20 points)
* value iteration (20 points)
* rander game (20 points)

## Hints
* Policy Evaluation<br/>

## Setup
* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* interminal, type: pip [install gym](https://pypi.org/project/gym/0.7.2/)
* interminal, type: pip [install nose](https://pypi.org/project/nose/)

## Guidelines
* Implement functions in mdp_dp.py
* Evaluate functions by typing "nosetests -v mdp_dp_test.py" in terminal (you need put mdp_dp.py and mdp_dp_test.py in the same folder)
* If you got error using "nosetests -v mdp_dp_test.py" due to python version (sometimes, nosetests will use python2.7 by default), try: python3 -m nose -v mdp_dp_test.py
