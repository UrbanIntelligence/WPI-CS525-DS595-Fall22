        -----------
        in_channels: number of channel of input.
                i.e The number of most recent frames stacked together, here we use 4 frames, which means each state in Breakout is composed of 4 frames.
        num_actions: number of action-value to output, one-to-one correspondence to action in game.

        You can add additional arguments as you need.
        In the constructor we instantiate modules and assign them as
        member variables.
